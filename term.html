        <p id="service-software">
            When You sign up for an account for Your organization You may specify one or more administrators. The
            administrators will have the right to configure the Services based on Your requirements and manage end users
            in Your organization account. If Your organization account is created and configured on Your behalf by a
            third party, it is likely that such third party has assumed administrator role for Your organization. Make
            sure that You enter into a suitable agreement with such third party specifying such party’s roles and
            restrictions as an administrator of Your organization account.

            You are responsible for (i) ensuring confidentiality of Your organization account password, (ii) appointing
            competent individuals as administrators for managing Your organization account, and (iii) ensuring that all
            activities that occur in connection with Your organization account comply with this Agreement. You
            understand that GBS is not responsible for account administration and internal management of the
            Services for You.

            You are responsible for taking necessary steps for ensuring that Your organization does not lose control of
            the administrator accounts. You may specify a process to be followed for recovering control in the event of
            such loss of control of the administrator accounts. In the absence of any specified administrator account
            recovery process, GBS may provide control of an administrator account to an individual providing proof
            satisfactory to GBS demonstrating authorization to act on behalf of the organization. You agree not to
            hold GBS liable for the consequences of any action taken by GBS in good faith in this regard.

        <h1>Inactive User Account Policy</h1>
        <p id="service-software">
            Promoted Brands reserve the right to terminate unpaid user accounts that are inactive for a continuous
            period. In the event of such termination, all data associated with such user account will be deleted. Brand
            will provide You prior notice of such termination and option to back-up Your data. The data deletion policy
            may be implemented with respect to any or all of the Services. Each Service will be considered an
            independent and separate service for the purpose of calculating the period of inactivity. In other words,
            activity in one of the Services is not sufficient to keep Your user account in another Service active. In
            case of accounts with more than one user, if at least one of the users is active, the account will not be
            considered inactive.

        <h1>Hosting Location</h1>
        <p id="service-software">
            The location of the cloud facility from which You are served depends on the mapping of Your region/country
            to the available cloud facilities at the time of Your sign-up. We may migrate Your account or require You to
            migrate Your account to a different cloud facility in the event of any updates to the region/country to
            cloud facility mapping at any point of time. You must not mask Your internet protocol (IP) address at the
            time of sign-up since Your region/country is determined based on Your IP address. If, at any time, Your
            actual region/country is found to be different from the region/country in Our records, GBS may take
            appropriate action such as migrate Your account or require You to migrate Your account to the cloud facility
            corresponding to Your region/country, or close Your account and deny the Service to You..
